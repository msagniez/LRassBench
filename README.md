# LRassBench
Long-reads de novo assembly benchmarking

This page gathers the input/output data and scripts used for our de novo assembly benchmarking analysis.
inputs consist of 5 datasets :
  - LSK114_SIRV_cDNA
  - LSK114_chrIS_mixA_cDNA
  - LSK109_chrIS_mixA_cDNA
  - RNA002_chrIS_mixA_dRNA
  - RNA004_chrIS_mixA_dRNA

See Figure1 for more information about this analysis.

- Tools-guide.txt = Installation guidelines and how tools were executed.
- Assembly-pipeline.sh = Commandlines executed for each of the tools tested (except Bambu which runs on R --> see Bambu-time.R instead).
- Bambu-tine.R = code to execute Bambu and Bambu-noRef for one sample.
